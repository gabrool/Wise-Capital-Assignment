<h1>Empirical Report: The Sun and the Market</h1>

Based strictly on your empirical results, I would not allocate capital to this signal as a standalone alpha at Wise Capital. 

Using 20 years of monthly data (2006–2025) and a one-month lag, the signal shows no statistically reliable relationship with next-month S&P 500 excess returns: 

Univariate regression: 

R-squared ≈ 0.004, t-stat ≈ 0.97, p-stat ≈ 0.33 

Seasonality-controlled regression: 

R-squared ≈ 0.045, t-stat ≈ 1.03, p-stat ≈ 0.30 

 

In both specifications, the sunspot coefficient is small and not statistically distinguishable from zero under Newey–West (HAC) standard errors, which is appropriate for monthly data with potential autocorrelation/heteroskedasticity. In other words, the model does not deliver evidence of incremental predictive content for returns at conventional confidence levels, and the explained variance is effectively negligible. 

For realized volatility, the results show a weak, non-significant negative association: 

Univariate regression: 

R-squared ≈ 0.027, t-stat ≈ -1.47, p-value ≈ 0.14 

Seasonality-controlled regression: 

R-squared ≈ 0.050, t-stat ≈ -1.47, p-value ≈ 0.14 

This is directionally interesting, but it still fails conventional significance thresholds and, crucially, Wise Capital would need a signal that is sufficiently reliable to endure transaction costs, risk constraints, and regime shifts. With p ≈ 0.14 and modest R-squared, the evidence is not strong enough to justify capital allocation without further validation.
